Scala.js-p5.js
==============
[Scala.js](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js) façade for [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js)

Façade of Scala.js is an interface to an existing JavaScript library, cf. https://www.scala-js.org/libraries/facades.html

Currently under development and [waiting Scala.js 1.0 release](https://www.scala-js.org/news/2019/11/26/announcing-scalajs-1.0.0-RC1/), 
aiming at compatibility with the latest p5.js and Scala.js 1.0.
